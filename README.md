# Introduction
1. Smartways are special types of roads that produce electricity while vehicles move over them.
2. They help use renewable energy and make transport systems more eco-friendly.
3. A step towards green and smart infrastructure.

# How It Works 
When vehicles pass over piezoelectric tiles, the pressure generates electric current.
Solar panels on roads absorb sunlight and turn it into usable power.
The collected energy is stored in batteries or sent to the power grid.
This energy can power streetlights, traffic signals, or even nearby buildings.
